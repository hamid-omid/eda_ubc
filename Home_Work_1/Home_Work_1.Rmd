#**STAT 545 Repository**


This is a repository made by **Hamid Omid** for course work of **[STAT 545](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC)** offered at the **[Universty of Bristish Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia)** in **Fall 2015**. Here is the link to main-page of course:
[STAT 545 webpage](http://stat545-ubc.github.io). The course is offered by **[Jenny](https://github.com/jennybc)**. I am excited to push my programming skills and data analysis expertise to a higher level.

I am in the last year of my PhD studying theoretical physics. My supervisor is **[Gordon Semenoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Walter_Semenoff)**. I am interested in Quantum Field Theories and their applications to Condensed Matter Systems. I have spent most of my recent years doing analytic calculations. I live in beautiful city of Vancouver. Here is a picture of our Campus at **UBC**:

To put this file on **GitHub**, I used **Git** through my **RStudio**. I used **R Mark Down** to write the original file and then **Knitted** it into **Mark Down**. To do so, I used the command
```[r}

My experience was not that pleasant as there were many issues with installing **Git** and connecting it to **RStudio** however I finally survived!

## **Warm Up for RStudio**


Let's start by doing some simple math on database "cars" provided by R. Let's load the data first:


```{r}
data(cars)
summary(cars)
```

As we see from the result of "summary" command data has two columns and fifty rows(observations). Lets see what is the data about exactly.
```{r}
?cars
```

We find out that "the data give the speed of cars and the distances taken to stop. Note that the data were recorded in the 1920s".

Let's plot the data then.

```{r}
plot(cars$speed,cars$dist,xlab ="Speed of Cars",ylab="Distance")
```
