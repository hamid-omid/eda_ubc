**STAT 545 Repository**
=======================

This is a repository made by **Hamid Omid** for course work of **[STAT 545](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC)** offered at the **[Universty of Bristish Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia)** in **Fall 2015**. Here is the link to main-page of course: [STAT 545 webpage](http://stat545-ubc.github.io). The course is offered by **[Jenny](https://github.com/jennybc)**. I am excited to push my programming skills and data analysis expertise to a higher level.

I am in the last year of my PhD studying theoretical physics. My supervisor is **[Gordon Semenoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Walter_Semenoff)**. I am interested in Quantum Field Theories and their applications to Condensed Matter Systems. I have spent most of my recent years doing analytic calculations. I live in beautiful city of Vancouver. Here is a picture of our Campus at **UBC**:
